Code coverage is used by millions of developers in thousands of organizations on a daily basis. Despite this popularity, code coverage has well-understood limitations demonstrated by the software engineering research community, such as not providing enough insight into test oraclesâ€™ quality. In this research, we compute coverage gaps, a metric to detect the undertested program structures by analyzing the existing test oracles. We then propose a lightweight intra-procedural flow-insensitive static analysis technique that uses the system under test (SUT) and the coverage gaps as inputs to recommend actionable feedback to the developers to complement the test suite with additional test oracles, which demonstrated to improve the fault-detection effectiveness of the test suite.
